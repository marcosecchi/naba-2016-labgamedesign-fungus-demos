# Fungus - 3D Demos

This project is a list of [Fungus](http://fungusgames.com/) demos originally created for the *Lab Game Design* course I held at [NABA](http://www.naba.it/) in 2016/2017.
Most of the examples were created on student request or as a solution for some topics raised during lessons.

Its main focus is 3D interaction, but many topics may be implemented also in 2D design.

## Scene List
