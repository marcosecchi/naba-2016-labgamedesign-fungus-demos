# Fungus - 3D Demos

This project is a list of [Fungus](http://fungusgames.com/) demos originally created for the *Lab Game Design* course I held at [NABA](http://www.naba.it/) in 2016/2017.

Its main focus is 3D interaction, but many topics may be implemented also in 2D design.

## Scene List

*  **Fungus3DDemo**: a game prototype involving collecting coins, powerups, activating triggers and avoiding traps.
*  **CameraControl**: this example shows how to control 3D Camera using Fungus.
*  **MouseAction**: this example shows how to create mouse interaction with a 3D object and a Flowchart in a scene.
*  **MovingPillars**: this example shows how to move several items using a flowchart each.
*  **MovingPlatform**: a simple scene where an FPS controller activates a moving platform and moves with it
*  **Pickup**: this example shows how to pickup an object through a trigger..
*  **Traps**: this example shows how to create traps using Physics and Triggers.
*  **Triggers**: this example shows how to activate a flowchart and execute it through a trigger. The flowchart will deactivate after a predefined time.
